                        <h1>Snake</h1>
                        <p>Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that 
                            moves across the screen, eating food items to grow longer.
                           As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to navigate without 
                           colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
                           The goal is to survive as long as possible while accumulating points by eating food.</p>

                        <h1>Blackjack</h1>
                        <p>Blackjack is a classic card game where players aim to beat the dealer
                           by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
                           Players can choose to "hit" for additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand.
                           The game involves strategy, risk assessment, and a bit of luck.</p>
